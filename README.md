# Battle-Quiz

Welcome, This is the Battle-Quiz ganme, nicknamed as "Bataquiz".
This is a roam / trivia style game. It is written in python, with the GUI using the pygame library, the input of the csv files using the pandas library and the randomization using the random library.

The goal of the game is to fight your opponents and to get the highest score in series of mini triva games about python.
On your way, be sure to not get hit by the spiders!

This project was intially developed as a school project and was presented at Google Kitchener in 2019.

I learned about python game development as well as project management while creating Bataquiz.

Special thanks to Paul Kokhanov for helping create the spider movement classes. 

I hope you enjoy the game!
Please tell me if there are bugs!
